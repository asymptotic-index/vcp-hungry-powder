# Scope and Ethics
Hungry Powder — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **scope**, **intent**, and **ethical framing** of the
Hungry Powder project. Because this concept relies on explicitly fictional
materials, clear boundaries are essential.

---

## Project Scope

Hungry Powder examines the following question:

> If we could chemically remove Venus’s atmosphere perfectly, would that make
> the planet habitable?

The project evaluates:
- Atmospheric mass removal requirements
- Chemical binding of CO₂ and N₂
- Resulting pressure changes
- Energy release from chemical reactions
- Interaction with planetary heat and solar energy balance

The analysis is quantitative once the fictional material assumption is granted.

---

## What Is Included

This project includes:
- Idealized chemical reactions for atmospheric removal
- Perfect reaction completeness and selectivity
- Global deployment of fictional materials
- Immediate atmospheric response modeling
- Conversion of results into intuitive scale comparisons

Optimism is used intentionally to expose lower bounds.

---

## Out of Scope

This project does **not**:
- Propose real chemical pathways
- Address manufacturing, transport, or containment
- Model biosphere development
- Advocate planetary modification

Material realism and engineering feasibility are intentionally excluded.

---

## Ethical Framing

Hungry Powder is framed as an **educational failure case**, not a proposal.

Ethical principles adopted:

- **Non-advocacy:**  
  The project does not argue that Venus should be modified.

- **Transparency:**  
  Fictional assumptions are clearly labeled and repeated.

- **Scale honesty:**  
  Results are expressed in human-comprehensible units.

- **Respect for physics:**  
  Conservation laws are never relaxed.

## Responsibility in Fantasy

Speculative ideas can mislead when treated casually. Hungry Powder treats fantasy
seriously enough to show **why it fails**, not to promote belief in it.

---

## Summary

> This project asks what happens *after* the atmosphere is removed.

Ethical clarity ensures fantasy serves understanding, not illusion.
