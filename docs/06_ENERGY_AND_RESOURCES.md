# Energy and Resources
Hungry Powder — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document quantifies the **energy flows and material resources** implied by
the Hungry Powder concept. The objective is to translate atmospheric chemistry
into concrete planetary-scale requirements.

---

## Atmospheric Mass and Composition

Total Venusian atmospheric mass:

- **~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg**

Approximate composition by mass:

- Carbon dioxide (CO₂): ~96.5%
- Nitrogen (N₂): ~3.5%

---

## Hungry Powder (HP) Mass Requirement

Carbon mass fraction of CO₂:

- Carbon ≈ 27% by mass

Carbon mass bound by HP:

- **~1.26 × 10²⁰ kg**

This represents the **minimum solid residue** produced by HP alone.

---

## Nitrogen Hungry Powder (NHP) Mass Requirement

Nitrogen removal mass:

- **~1.68 × 10¹⁹ kg**

This additional mass is required to reduce pressure below survivable limits.

---

## Total Solid Residue

Combined HP + NHP residue:

- **~1.4 × 10²⁰ kg**

This mass must be stored permanently on or off Venus.

---

## Burial Depth Estimate

If residue is spread evenly across Venus’s surface:

- Venus surface area ≈ 4.6 × 10¹⁴ m²
- Mean density (optimistic) ≈ 2,000 kg/m³

Resulting global burial depth:

- **~150 meters**

Venus becomes a chemically buried planet.

---

## Chemical Energy Release

Atmospheric binding reactions are exothermic.

Lower-bound heat release estimates:
- Comparable to atmospheric thermal energy (~10²⁶ J)
- Added on top of existing planetary heat

No mechanism exists to remove this heat.

---

## Continuous Solar Energy Input

Venus absorbs solar power at approximately:

- **~1.6 × 10¹⁷ W**

Per year:

- **~5 × 10²⁴ J**

Hungry Powder does nothing to stop this inflow.

---

## Energy Comparison (Illustrative)

- Total chemical heat released: ~10²⁶ J
- One year of solar input: ~5 × 10²⁴ J
- Human annual energy use: ~6 × 10²⁰ J

Venus receives **millions of years** of human energy use every year.

---

## Key Insight

> Hungry Powder must manage **planetary heat**, not just atmospheric mass.

Material solutions scale linearly. Planetary energy does not.

---

## Summary

- Material mass requirements are planetary
- Chemical reactions add heat
- Solar input dominates long-term behavior

Hungry Powder fails on energy, not imagination.
