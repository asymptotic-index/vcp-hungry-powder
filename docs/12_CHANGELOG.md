Hungry Powder — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Versioning Scheme

This project follows a simplified semantic versioning model:

- **MAJOR** — Conceptual reframing or change in fantasy assumptions
- **MINOR** — New analytical sections, extensions, or comparisons
- **PATCH** — Clarifications, corrections, formatting, or numerical cleanup

---

## Change Log

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release (Fantasy Failure Case)
- Defined Hungry Powder (HP) as a fictional CO₂-removal material
- Introduced Nitrogen Hungry Powder (NHP) for residual pressure removal
- Quantified Venusian atmospheric mass and composition
- Calculated required material masses for pressure reduction
- Demonstrated global solid residue burial exceeding 100 meters
- Analyzed residual pressure after CO₂-only removal
- Evaluated chemical heat release and energy balance dominance
- Showed that atmospheric chemistry alone does not cool Venus
- Documented why pressure reduction ≠ habitability
- Classified the concept explicitly as **Fantasy**

---

## Notes

Hungry Powder is preserved as a **rigorous educational failure case**.

Future revisions may:
- Refine numerical estimates
- Add visualizations or diagrams
- Expand comparative context with other Venus Cooling Project concepts

However, the core conclusion is stable:

> Venus is governed by planetary energy flows,  
> not atmospheric composition alone.
