# Scale Comparisons
Hungry Powder — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides **scale comparisons** to translate planetary quantities
into human-scale intuition. Hungry Powder fails quietly in equations, but
dramatically in scale.

All comparisons are illustrative, not sensational.

## Atmospheric Mass in Familiar Terms

Total Venusian atmospheric mass:

- **~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg**

### Tesla Cybertruck Equivalent

Assume:
- Mass per Tesla Cybertruck ≈ 3,000 kg

Equivalent number of Cybertrucks:

- **~1.6 × 10¹⁷ Cybertrucks**

That is:
- 160 quadrillion trucks
- Enough to cover Earth thousands of times over

---

## Hungry Powder Residue Mass

Total solid residue (HP + NHP):

- **~1.4 × 10²⁰ kg**

If transported to Earth:
- Would outweigh all human-made objects by **billions of times**

---

## Global Burial Depth

If residue is evenly spread:

- Venus surface area ≈ 4.6 × 10¹⁴ m²
- Average depth ≈ **150 meters**

That is:
- Taller than a 40-story building
- Covering the entire planet

## Energy Scale — AA Batteries

Atmospheric thermal energy:

- **~10²⁶ J**

Energy per AA battery:

- ~10,000 J

Equivalent AA batteries:

- **~1 × 10²² batteries**

Stacked end to end, they would extend far beyond the Solar System.

---

## Solar Energy Comparison

Venus receives annually:

- **~5 × 10²⁴ J**

That is equivalent to:
- ~500 trillion AA batteries *every year*

Hungry Powder must compete with this continuously.

---

## Human Activity Comparison

Total human energy use per year:

- ~6 × 10²⁰ J

Venus receives:
- **~8,000×** that amount annually

---

## Why These Comparisons Matter

Hungry Powder sounds manageable because chemistry feels familiar.

These comparisons show:
- The problem is not chemistry
- The problem is **planetary scale**

---

## Summary

> Hungry Powder collapses under the weight of numbers.

The intuition fails not gradually, but instantly.
