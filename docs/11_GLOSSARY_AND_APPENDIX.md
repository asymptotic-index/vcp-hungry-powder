# Glossary and Appendix
Hungry Powder — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose

This document provides a **reference glossary and appendix** for terminology,
symbols, constants, and shorthand used throughout the Hungry Powder repository.

It exists to reduce cognitive load for readers and keep discussions precise and
consistent. No new arguments are introduced here.

## Glossary — Core Concepts

### Hungry Powder (HP)
A fictional material that selectively removes carbon dioxide (CO₂) from Venus’s
atmosphere by binding carbon into an inert solid while releasing oxygen.

---

### Nitrogen Hungry Powder (NHP)
A fictional companion material that removes atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) through an
analogous irreversible binding process.

---

### Atmospheric Mass
The total mass of gases bound to a planet by gravity. For Venus, this quantity
dominates all chemical intervention strategies.

---

### Surface Pressure
The force per unit area exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. Pressure
reduction alone does not guarantee temperature reduction.

---

### Planetary Energy Balance
The accounting of all energy entering, leaving, and stored within a planetary
system. Long-term climate is governed by balance, not composition.

---

### Greenhouse Effect
The trapping of infrared radiation by atmospheric gases. While important, it is
not the sole determinant of Venus’s temperature.

---

### Thermal Inertia
The resistance of a system to temperature change due to stored heat in the
atmosphere, surface, and interior.

---

### Fantasy Classification
A project designation indicating that key mechanisms violate known physics but
are analyzed quantitatively to expose scale and limits.

## Notes on Interpretation

- All values are order-of-magnitude unless stated otherwise
- SI units are used throughout
- Fictional mechanisms do not override physical accounting
- Scale comparisons are illustrative, not prescriptive

## Closing Note

> Hungry Powder is not limited by imagination,  
> but by arithmetic.

This appendix exists to keep fantasy grounded in numbers.
