# Assumptions
Hungry Powder — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** used throughout the Hungry
Powder analysis. These assumptions are intentionally generous and optimistic to
establish **best-case lower bounds**.

If Hungry Powder fails under these assumptions, it cannot succeed under any more
realistic framing.

## Fictional Material Assumptions

The following properties are assumed for analysis purposes only:

### Hungry Powder (HP)
- Selectively removes CO₂ from Venus’s atmosphere
- Binds carbon into a chemically inert, stable solid
- Releases oxygen without recombination
- Operates at all Venusian temperatures and pressures
- Does not degrade, saturate, or fail over time

### Nitrogen Hungry Powder (NHP)
- Selectively removes N₂
- Permanently binds nitrogen into a stable solid
- Does not interfere with oxygen or other gases
- Operates continuously and globally

These materials do **not** exist and are not claimed to be physically possible.

---

## Reaction Assumptions

- Chemical reactions are perfectly efficient
- All target gas molecules are captured where material is present
- No parasitic or side reactions occur unless explicitly discussed
- Reaction kinetics are not rate-limiting

This removes chemical inefficiencies entirely.

---

## Deployment Assumptions

It is assumed that:
- Arbitrary quantities of HP and NHP can be produced
- Materials can be deployed globally and uniformly
- Perfect contact with the entire atmosphere is achieved
- Gravity, transport, and containment pose no obstacles

Logistics and engineering constraints are intentionally ignored.

## Planetary Assumptions

Baseline Venus properties are treated as fixed unless directly altered:

- Atmospheric mass: ~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg  
- Surface pressure: ~92 bar  
- Mean surface temperature: ~737 K  
- Atmospheric composition: CO₂-dominant with N₂ secondary  
- Solar flux at Venus: ~2,613 W/m²

## Energy Accounting Assumptions

Despite fictional materials:
- Conservation of mass applies
- Conservation of energy applies
- Heat released by reactions is accounted for
- Incoming solar energy continues uninterrupted

Chemical removal does not negate planetary energy balance.

---

## Temporal Assumptions

- Atmospheric removal can occur gradually or instantaneously
- Long-term equilibrium behavior is considered
- Short-term weather dynamics are ignored

---

## Interpretive Assumptions

- Analysis is non-advocacy
- Results are expressed conservatively
- Scale comparisons prioritize intuition over spectacle

---

## Summary

> These assumptions give Hungry Powder every conceivable advantage.

Even so, planetary heat and mass dominate outcomes.
