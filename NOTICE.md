# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies examining real, theoretical, speculative, and deliberately
fantastical approaches to planetary cooling and climate modification.

The **Hungry Powder** project is explicitly classified as **Fantasy**.

It explores a fictional class of materials capable of chemically removing
Venus’s atmospheric gases:
- **Hungry Powder (HP)** removes carbon dioxide by binding carbon into an inert
  solid while releasing oxygen.
- **Nitrogen Hungry Powder (NHP)** removes atmospheric nitrogen through an
  analogous binding process.

These materials do **not** exist and are not claimed to be physically realizable.

Once the fictional material assumption is granted, all subsequent analysis
follows standard principles of:
- Conservation of mass
- Conservation of energy
- Thermodynamics
- Planetary energy balance

This repository is **not**:
- A proposal for new materials
- A viable terraforming plan
- An endorsement of planetary modification
- A workaround for physical laws

The purpose of Hungry Powder is to demonstrate that even perfect atmospheric
removal fails to make Venus habitable because **heat and solar energy balance
dominate planetary climate**.

Chemical manipulation alone cannot overcome:
- Planetary thermal inertia
- Continuous solar input
- Heat released by recombination reactions
- Irreversible energy storage at scale

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, analysis, and presentation** of
this material as an educational and narrative failure-case study.

If this material is referenced or reused, attribution to the project or
repository is appreciated.

This repository exists to answer a deceptively simple question honestly:

> *If we could remove Venus’s atmosphere perfectly, would that actually solve the
> problem?*
